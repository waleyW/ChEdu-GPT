ChEdu is an innovative AI-powered teaching assistant specifically designed for chemistry education. Unlike traditional AI chatbots that simply provide answers, ChEdu employs Socratic questioning methods to guide students through progressive learning, fostering critical thinking and deep understanding.

## 🌟 Key Features

- **Guided Learning**: Implements Socratic questioning to lead students to discover answers independently
- **Course Customization**: Easily adaptable to any chemistry curriculum or teaching style
- **Dual-System Architecture**: Combines RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) for accurate information retrieval with fine-tuned LLM for intelligent guidance  
- **Privacy-First**: Local deployment ensures student data security
- **No Coding Required**: User-friendly interface for educators without technical background

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- **Hardware**: NVIDIA GPU with ≥16GB VRAM (RTX 3090 or equivalent)
- **Software**: Python 3.10+, CUDA 12.1+
- **Storage**: 50GB available space

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/waleyW/ChEdu-GPT.git
cd ChEdu-GPT
```

2. **Create virtual environment**
```bash
conda create -n chedu python=3.10
conda activate chedu
```

3. **Install dependencies**
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Basic Usage

1. **Prepare your data**
```bash
# Customize data collection for your course
python code/data_collection.py --num_dialogues 1000

# Convert to training format
python code/Data_json.py
```

2. **Train your custom model**
```bash
python code/train.py \
    --dataset ./Dataset/json/chemistry_educational_dialogs.json \
    --output_dir ./models/my_chedu_model
```

3. **Deploy the system**
```bash
# Start the AI teaching assistant
python code/RAG_LLM.py

# Access the web interface at http://localhost:7860
```
